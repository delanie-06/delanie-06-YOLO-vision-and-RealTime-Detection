# Real-Time Object Detection and Tracking using YOLOv8

Welcome to the **Real-Time Object Detection and Tracking** project, developed using the state-of-the-art YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) algorithm. This project focuses on identifying and tracking multiple objects in high-definition videos with exceptional accuracy and real-time performance.

## üöÄ Features
- **High Accuracy:** Leveraging YOLOv8 for precise object detection.
- **Real-Time Processing:** Capable of processing frames dynamically at high speeds.
- **Multi-Object Detection:** Detects multiple objects like people, vehicles, and more with confidence scores.
- **Annotated Video Output:** Generates a video with labeled and bounded detected objects.

---

## üìã Objectives
1. Implement real-time object detection in video streams using YOLOv8.
2. Evaluate performance via frames per second (FPS) and detection accuracy.
3. Produce annotated output videos with identified objects.

---

## üìÇ Project Structure
### Code Components:
1. **Model Loading:** YOLOv8 loads to process each video frame.
2. **Video Setup:** Using OpenCV, input videos are loaded, and FPS is computed.
3. **Object Detection and Tracking:** YOLOv8 detects objects in frames, adding bounding boxes and labels.
4. **Output Generation:** Annotated frames are compiled into a new video.

## üíª Technology Stack
- **Framework:** YOLOv8
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV, Ultralytics

Option 2: Embed from YouTube or Vimeo (recommended)
If you'd like to have the video embedded directly in the README (with playback controls), you can upload the video to a platform like YouTube or Vimeo, then embed it using the embed code provided by those platforms.

For example, after uploading your videos to YouTube, use the embed code like this:

## üé• Workflow Overview
1. Input a high-definition video (e.g., an urban street scene).
2. YOLOv8 processes each frame for object detection.
3. The system overlays bounding boxes and labels on detected objects.
4. Outputs an annotated video for real-world use cases like surveillance or traffic monitoring.

## üìä Performance Evaluation
- **Frames Per Second (FPS):** Evaluates real-time processing efficiency.
- **Strengths:**
  - High detection accuracy.
  - Real-time multi-object detection.
- **Limitations:**
  - Resource-intensive (requires a robust system).
  - Performance affected by challenging lighting and complex backgrounds.
